# cqt-analyzer
Spectral Analyzer audio plugin based on the [Constant-Q transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant-Q_transform). Hence, the plugin offers equal resolution over all octaves and displays one value for each of the 12 notes within the equal-tempered scale. 
The original intention for this plugin was to serve as visualization for my [CQT implementation](https://github.com/jmerkt/rt-cqt).

The plugin is based on the [iPlug2 framework](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2).
